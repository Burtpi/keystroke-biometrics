# keystroke-biometrics


## Credits

This project makes use of the following open-source libraries:

- [Wooting Analog SDK](https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-analog-sdk) - An open driver for Analog keyboards. Used to collect data about keystroke dynamics.
- [GSL (GNU Scientific Library)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) - A numerical library for C and C++ programmers. Used for interpolation.
- [FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West)](http://www.fftw.org/) - A comprehensive library for computing discrete Fourier transforms.
- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) - A fast, header-only C++ logging library.
